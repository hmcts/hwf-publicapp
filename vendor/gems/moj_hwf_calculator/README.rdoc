= MojHwfCalculator

== Application Testing Using Page Objects

This gem exposes its page objects for use by your application using the following :-

```ruby

require 'moj_hwf/calculator/page_objects'

```

Which then defines the following :-

```
MojHwf::Calculator::Test::En::BasePage
MojHwf::Calculator::Test::En::CourtFeePage
MojHwf::Calculator::Test::En::DateOfBirthPage
MojHwf::Calculator::Test::En::MaritalStatusPage
MojHwf::Calculator::Test::En::StartPage
MojHwf::Calculator::Test::En::TotalSavingsPage

```

along with welsh equivalents coming soon...
